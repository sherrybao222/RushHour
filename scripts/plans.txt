	try python optimization on cluster
	cross-validation (multi-start)
	fit myopic and BFS
	fit all subject data on cluster
		parameters estimates across subjects, mean loglikelihood across subjects
April 6:
	summary statistics predicted (data vs model vs random) F2.14
	value-based stopping model (best option hasn't changed for k iterations then stop)
	response time
	model predicts individual difference F2.15
April 13:
	thinking theoretically about restart and surrender
	code restart and surrender model
April 20:
	fit restart and surrender model
	summary statistics for restart and surrender
April 27:
